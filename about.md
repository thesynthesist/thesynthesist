Over the years, I’ve had the chance to work alongside some of the legends of electronic music — artists and thinkers who’ve reshaped the way we hear. That experience shaped my approach: intuitive, emotionally precise, and deeply curious.

Whether it’s a cinematic score, a spatial sound piece, or a sync brief with tight turnaround, I approach sound as a sculptural, narrative force. My toolbox is a blend of the classic and the cutting edge: Ableton Live is my central workspace, supported by a growing ecosystem of analog and hardware synths, modular gear, and tactile controllers. I’m also working extensively with Dolby Atmos and immersive formats, exploring how spatial sound can deepen emotional impact.

Lately, I’ve been integrating AI into my process — not as a shortcut, but as a collaborator that opens new creative questions.

I’m especially drawn to projects that exist slightly left of center — experimental work, hybrid formats, or anything that lives between disciplines. Whether composing solo or collaborating across teams, I value sonic storytelling that leaves room for silence, tension, and surprise.

Currently based in the UK, I’m open to new collaborations — from freelance composing and production to sound design for film, games, installations, and everything in between.
